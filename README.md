# coffee - COmplete your Favourite FEEd

This project aims to help you complete your favourite feed. Be it [Paul Graham's essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) or [High Scalability all time favorites](http://highscalability.com/all-time-favorites/).

You can set it up to receive old content from the feed after fixed intervals and it's only a matter of months to finish up the feed you always wanted to read.

Happy Reading :)
